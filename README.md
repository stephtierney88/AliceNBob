Alice and Bob  Vector transmission over an Imaginary Abstract Topological Grid Space
(Turning Compression into a Computation problem)
Warning Beware of Meta Vectors that point to new Vector Sets
Hmmm next steps need to think of how path finding with work... Constraints avoid properties of grid that blow up like angle precision and keeping too much of grid in view. Procedurally generate parts of grids until you get to destination.  


Binary is a set of T/F statements to navigate a statespace essentially asking which half the state sought after is in repeatedly narrowing down your search, but you can do better by folding the statespace to an agreed upon topology and using a series of vectors tip to tail to point at the state in question directly from outside the statespace likely from the origin if using a spherical topology. Vector array something like: scale factor, x, y, z, quadInfo... zooming in on your point.   This state can represent your number. Ehh do i really want to work on this though... eh...
